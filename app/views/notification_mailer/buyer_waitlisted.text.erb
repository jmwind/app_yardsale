Hi <%= @buyer.name.truncate_words(1, omission: '') %>,
You've been added to the waiting for <%= @product.title %> at <%=@shop.url%>.

<% if @buyer.raise? %>

You've suggested another price of <%= number_to_currency(@buyer.raise) %>. If it's accepted you'll be e-mailed the details. Otherwise,
we will e-mail you if the item sells or is available again.

<% else %>

If the current buyer changes her mind, you'll be notified by e-mail and have a chance to reserve again.

<% end %>

Thanks!
