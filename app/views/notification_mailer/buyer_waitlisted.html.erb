You've suggested another price of <%= number_to_currency(@buyer.raise) %>. If it's accepted you'll be e-mailed the details. Otherwise,
we will e-mail you if the item sells or is available again.

If the current buyer changes her mind, you'll be notified by e-mail and have a chance to reserve again.

Thanks!
