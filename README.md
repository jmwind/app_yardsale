# Shopify Yard Sale App

The yard sale app allows you to sell personal online items without having to deal with the frustrating logistical hassles of Craigslist style marketplaces. Whether you’re selling in Australia on Gumtree or in France on LeBonCoin, use them as a marketing channel not a commerce platform.

Gone are the days of listing an item and getting dozen of text messages from potential buyers. Having to track who contacted you first and who wanted to pay more. Let Shopify handle the logistics, while you collect the money.

This is what it used to feel like when selling on-line:

# Main Features

* Allows buyers to reserve a product, and pay via COD.

* When an item is reserved, other interested buyers can add themselves to a waiting list in-case the first buyer backs out (which is very common in yard sales).

* Allows waitlisted buyers to submit a bid on a reserved item. The app manages the notifications to the current buyer for a right to match the bid and then transferring the order to the new buyer.

* If a buyer backs out of purchasing an item, the admin interface allows you to release an item and notify everyone on the waiting list that it’s now available. The app supports two release options.

* The first clears the waiting list and sends an e-mail to the waitlist that the item is now back on the market. In this case it’s first come first serve regardless of which position in line they where.

* The second release option is sequential. It notifies the next person in line that they can purchase the item and you can keep the waiting list intact and notify by mail that they have rights to the item now.
