List of things that are f#$%@

- had to comment out forgery filter in ApplicationController that is bogus
- waitlist_controller::create should be able to update new buyers instead of setting each parameter
- javascript clean-up instead of updating dom, get fragment from the server as ajax
- form validation in the waitlist form could be a lot better
